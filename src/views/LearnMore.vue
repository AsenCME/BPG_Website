        <span>Using anonymous location tracking with active participation of our users, we expect to streamline our heat mapping system, that will display, in an easy to use user-interface, where the problem areas are, as well as potential areas where one might experience delays, or full trains where one might experience an uncomfortable riding experience. Users will have the chance to help not only themselves, but also their fellow MÃ¼ncheners by reporting inconsistencies, inconveniences, as well as rating their overall ride. This data will be input into a sort of blockchain where all like data will be analyzed to find patterns. And these patterns will be analyzed by our app to produce alternatives for all riders of MVV.</span>

            description="Rating is easier than ever. You will be asked to rate when our app knows that you have finished your journey. If you choose not to rate the trip right away? No problem, you will be notified at a frequency of your choice, or you can select a journey from your journey history at any time and give it a rating. However, it is always better to rate your journey as soon as you can, as it will help us improve our app for your future transportation experiences."

        <span>Rating only requires a few seconds of your time after each journey. Rating can only help you. By rating you are allowing our app to grow its databases and to improve the information it provides. The app then can give more precise options catered to your needs. The more you rate, the more data we have and next time your train is delayed, you will know, and you can easily choose an alternative route, maybe even one we have created and customized for you. But one thing is for sure, rate so you are not late!</span>

          After conducting extensive research and asking already over 100-people whether they would use the app or not, we have concluded that continuing with this project is highly advisable. We have found an astounding amount of people who would like to improve their public transpotation in often more ways than one. We have received a lot of helpful input. And we look forward to hearing more of what people have to say

        <span>Since it is no secret that the public transportation in Munich is out-dated, inefficient, and anything but reliable. We feel it is our public duty to end procrastination related with improving the official public transportation system, and start doing what we can as a society. We no longer want to wait endlessly for our government to go through 20-years of paperwork and bureaucracy, to do what they could be doing now. We have the technology, so why wait? Let's make "Our" public transportation system the best it can be. Transportr is our portal into the future.</span>
